# CS-BS-Challenge

CS BS Challenge is a board game that involves one human player and two AI players.
The theme of the game revolves around the experiences of a student pursuing
a Computer Science degree at CSULB.

Each player has a set of skill points: Learning, Craft, and Integrity. These skill points
are used as prerequisites for some of the cards. Each player also has a number of "quality points"
that are earned upon successfully playing certain cards. 

Each card requires the player that played it to be in a certain room. If the player does not meet
the room requirement, he/she loses two quality points. If the player does meet the room requirement, he/she
may receive a reward or the card will check to see if the player meets the skill point requirement. The player then
may receive a reward or penalty based on the card

Once the game reaches a total quality point amount of 60 between each player, the game enters "Sophomore Year".
New cards are added to the deck and each player has their hand reshuffled.

Lastly, the game completes once a player reaches 120 quality points.
